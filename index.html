          <p>
            I graduated from Yildiz Technical University Mechatronics
            Engineering program in February 2018. Since my education language
            was English, I used to be able to speak English fluently.However,I
            thought that I should improve my speaking skills far more as I
            always tend to enhance my technical knowledge and social skills so
            that's why I subscribed a speaking practice application called
            Cambly.For just about 3 years,I have been using this application so
            I am pretty much fluent in English now. To improve myself even more,
            I have been learning italian for 1 year. And I got B1 in italian now
            I am moving on B2.I also know many computer program such as
            C,C#,java, Python,matlab and so on.Furthermore,I've been following a
            QA test engineering bootcamp for just about 4 months to be able to
            brush up upon my software skill and also learn new testing tools.To
            sum up, I'm highly motivated to learn more and always striving to
            get myself up to speed about the latest development.
